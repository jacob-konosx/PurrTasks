## KristiƒÅns Review that did not fit in specific files
- Missing README and how to setup the project, what env variables are needed
- Would recommend using PNPM instead of NPM, saves you space on the PC
- App should only contain routes/components specific to those routes, lib/overall components should be outside
- Components are too far away from where they are used at places
- Prefer function over const syntax 
- Inconsistent variable naming patterns
